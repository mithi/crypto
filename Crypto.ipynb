    "Bitcoin has had quite a year this 2017, up to more than 1700% increase year to date. With this exponential increase, comes an equivalent interest in mining them. Some think it's a scam, while others think it's a great investment. Given what I've seen online, and the many variables involved, I haven't really encountered a thorough article that allows me to draw an unbiased conclusion by myself. This article is my attempt to gather my thoughts and hopefully provide that. \n",
