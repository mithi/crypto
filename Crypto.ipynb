    "Bitcoin has had quite a year this 2017, up to more than 1700% increase year to date. With this exponential increase, comes an equivalent interest in mining them. Some think it's a scam, while others think it's a great investment. Given what I've seen online, and the many variables involved, I haven't really encountered a thorough article that allows me to draw an unbiased conclusion by myself. This article is my attempt to gather my thoughts and hopefully provide that. \n",

    "Theoretically and on average, it is targeted that every 10 minutes, a block is solved by the network of miners. Each time a block is solved, a number of bitcoins is added to the network by being awarded to the miner (or mining pool) who solved it. This number of bitcoins is the block reward which is currently `12.5`. This value will halve every 210,000 blocks, with the next halving still more than 2 years away [See: Bitcoin Block Half](bitcoinblockhalf.com). Estimating your piece of the pie or the fraction you will get is simple; it's your hashrate divided by the total hashrate of all the computers participating in the network.
